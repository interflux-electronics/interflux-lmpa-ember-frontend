<h2>Reduce <strong>heat-related</strong> board and component failures</h2>
<p>Soldering SAC requires temperatures of 220 -260 C degrees. The melting point of LMPAâ„¢ occurs at 170C and thus enables you to solder at lower temperatures.  This means you can work with more fragile components, there will be less warping, less melting and more X.</p>
