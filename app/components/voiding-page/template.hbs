  <h2><strong>Reduce solder voiding</strong>, increase mechanical strength and conductivity</h2>
  <p>Void formation under components with large soldering planes and low stand-off heights, such as QFN components, is a well-known phenomenon. These air pockets can reduce <strong>mechanical strength</strong> as well <strong>electrical and thermal conductivity</strong>. For Sn(Ag)Cu-based alloys, voiding levels are commonly in between 22 and 40%. With the LMPA<sup>&trade;</sup>-Q alloy voiding levels can be reduced <strong>below 8%</strong>.</p>
